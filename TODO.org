* [1/1] Constants
  - [X] Constant symbols cannot be ns-qualified but quasiquote will qualify
    them.
* [1/1] Meta Data
  - [X] defn and defmacro macros are not merging new meta data
    : (defn #^{:private true} foo "docstring" [] ...)
    In the previous form, foo will have the meta
    : ~{:doc "docstring"} but not the :private key
    Me thinks the problem is with-meta overwrites an object's existing meta
    map.... Nope, it was in the definition of defn and defmacro.
* [1/1] Destructure
  - [ ] The destructure function depends on a hash-able hashmap. Clojure's
    maps are immutable, so this works. Not so with sexp. SxHashmap is
    currently hashed by its pointer /which is crap/ but it works for now.
